# hello_world

A brief introduction to myself. 

I'm a student doing the last year of the degree in Biomedicine in the university of Seville. I'm an enthusiastic bioinformatics independent learner and very interested in the new emerging omics techniques. 

This repository aims to show the omics and bioinformatics techniques that, personally, I have learned along the grade of Biomedicine. More precisely, in this repository I've build some branches that gather the four main projects learned in _bioinformatics and omics techniques_ subject: phylogeny analysis, microarray processing data, and RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data analysis.
